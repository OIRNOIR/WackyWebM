- Every line consists of 4 (or 3) comma-seperated values:
  - first, the time in the video of the keyframe; either one integer representing seconds, or two, seperated by any one of the characters `.`, `:` or `-`, where the first still represents seconds, and the second represents frames.
  - next, the width, then the height at that keyframe (in pixels)
  - finally, the interpolation with which to advance towards the next keyframe - currently, the following are supported:
    - `linear`: linearly interpolates towards the next keyframe. if the line only contains 3 values, this mode is implied, so it is not required to be written out every time.
    - `instant`: instantly sets the size to the given values
- If it isn't overwritten, an implicit keyframe at 0 frames into the video is added with linear interpolation and the video's original size.
- To use this mode, add `-k` with the path to your csv file.
