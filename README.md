# WackyWebM

This is a simple tool to allow you to create WebM files with changing aspect ratios.

If you're having trouble installing the dependencies, or need help running the code, [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjGMjv1Gv94) is super helpful.

## Dependencies

- NodeJS
- ffmpeg
- ffprobe

## How to run

`node wackywebm.js [mode] <file>`

If you're on windows, you can simply double-click `run.bat`, as long as it's in the same folder as `wackywebm.js`.

If you're on MacOS or Linux, you can run `run.sh`. You may have to give it permission to execute with `chmod +x run.sh`.

You can also tweak the script to taste if you want to adjust how your file is generated.

You can also change the bitrate of the output file by tweaking `-b` (Default is 1M, which means 1 MB/s. If the file is too large, consider lowering this value.)

## Mode options

- `Bounce` (Default): The video bounces up and down.
- `Shutter`: The video bounces left to right.
- `Sporadic`: The video glitches and wobbles randomly.
- `Shrink`: The video shrinks vertically until it's just one pixel thin.
- `AudioBounce`: The video's vertical height changes relative to the current audio level verses the highest within the video.
- `AudioShutter`: The video's horizontal width changes relative to the current audio level verses the highest within the video.
- `Keyframes`: The video's height and width change based on a number of keyframes outlined in the file given as an argument. The format is as follows:
  - Every line consists of 4 comma-seperated values:
    - first, the time in the video of the keyframe; either one integer representing seconds, or two, seperated by any one of the characters `.`, `:` or `-`, where the first still represents seconds, and the second represents frames.
    - next, the width, then the height at that keyframe (in pixels)
    - finally, the interpolation with which to advance towards the next keyframe (currently, only `linear` is supported.)
  - If it isn't overwritten, an implicit keyframe at 0 frames into the video is added with linear interpolation and the video's original size.
  - To use this mode, add `-k` with the path to your csv file.
- `Jumpscare`: The video shrinks down small, then gets big at the specified frame.

Additionally, any 2 modes can be combined using a `+` symbol, like `Bounce+Shutter`. If one only specifies width, and one only specifies height, then those respective values are used. If there is a conflict, the value from the latter of the 2 modes is used (so `Shrink+Bounce` would result in the same effect as just `Bounce`)
